      <description>This operator forwards tuples from one of its input ports to its output port.
The Selector operator can be used in a consistent region.  It must have at
least one input port, and typically has multiple input ports.  It has exactly
one output port.  When used in a consistent region, it selects the input port
from which it receives the first tuple.  It forwards all tuples from that port
to its output port, and discards tuples from the others.  On reset, it stops
using the input port it had selected, and again selects the port from which
it receives the first tuple.

Limitations
If this is used as an operator-driven start operator, it never initiates a drain.

Recommendations
This operator is part of the ReplayableStart operator, and probably is not useful
on its own.
