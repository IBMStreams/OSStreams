{
    /*! \brief Class that serves as a handler for operator state. The handler is
     *  used when the operator is checkpointing or is in a consistent region.
     *
     *  If an operator is an instance of StateHandler then it is automatically
     *  registered as a state handler, otherwise an operator registers an instance
     *  of StateHandler using OperatorContext::registerStateHandler(StateHandler &).
     *  Operators that need to manage state are encouraged to always utilize a StateHandler
     *  by either extending StateHandler or registering a state handler.
     *
     *  StateHandler implementations should be careful to honor the contract of this
     *  interface to allow use in future scenarios. For example, no assumptions
     *  should be made about the operator being in a consistent region or checkpointing,
     *  and tuple submission should only occur from drain().
     *
     *  When periodic checkpointing is enabled, the SPL Runtime will call checkpoint(Checkpoint&)
     *  for the registered state handler at the configured period. With operator driven
     *  checkpointing, the operator call CheckpointContext::createCheckpoint() to create
     *  a checkpoint, that will result in a callback to checkpoint(Checkpoint&) for the
     *  registered handler. These callbacks occur on the thread that originated the create checkpoint
     *  request.
     *  After PE restart, the SPL Runtime will reset the operator to a persisted state by calling
     *  reset(Checkpoint&) or resetToInitialState().
     *
     *  In a consistent region, the methods drain() and checkpoint(Checkpoint&) are periodically
     *  invoked, according
     *  to the consistent region configuration (periodic or operator-driven). On a drain(),
     *  the operator must finish any outstanding processing related to tuples processed prior
     *  to the drain() call. On a checkpoint(Checkpoint&), the operator can persist its state to the
     *  checkpointing backed. The persisted state is guaranteed to be consistent with the state
     *  of all other operators in the consistent region. After a failure of any operator in the region,
     *  the SPL Runtime will reset the operator to the last successfully persisted consistent state
     *  by calling reset(Checkpoint&) or resetToInitialState().
     *
     *  If the operator code enables non-blocking checkpoint (via invoking
     *  ConsistentRegionContext::enableNonBlockingCheckpoint()), the prepareForNonBlockingCheckpoint(int64_t)
     *  method is invoked by the SPL Runtime after the drain() method. The tuple flow is resumed after
     *  the return of prepareForNonBlockingCheckpoint(int64_t) method. Meanwhile the SPL Runtime delegates an
     *  internal thread to execute the operatorâ€™s checkpoint(Checkpoint&) method in the background. Background
     *  checkpointing is internally tracked by the SPL Runtime.
     *
     *  For a start operator of a consistent region, the regionCheckpointed(int64_t) method is called once all
     *  the operators in the consistent region is drained an checkpointed, including those operators
     *  performing non-blocking checkpointing.
