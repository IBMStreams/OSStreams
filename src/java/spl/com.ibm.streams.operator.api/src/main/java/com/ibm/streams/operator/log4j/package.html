SPL trace and logging for the Java Operator API using the Apache log4j logging facilities.
The SPL Runtime provides Apache log4j version 1.2.16.
<H2>SPL Log Facility - com.ibm.streams.operator.log Logger</H2>
<P>
The SPL log facility is for application <em>logging</em>, where logging is defined as
the recording of serviceability information pertaining to application or operator events.
The purpose of logging is to provide an administrator with enough information
to do problem determination for items they can potentially control.
In general, very few events are logged in the normal running scenario of an application or operator.
Events pertinent to the failure or partial failure of application runtime scenarios should be logged.
</P>
<P>
The {@code org.apache.log4j.Logger} named {@code com.ibm.streams.operator.log} delivers
log messages to the SPL log facility. {@link com.ibm.streams.operator.log4j.LogLevel} provides Java values for SPL log levels
and also describes the mapping between Apache log4j {@code org.apache.log4j.Level} values
and SPL log levels.
<BR>
This {@code Logger} accepts any {@code Level} but any log messages at a level
below {@link com.ibm.streams.operator.log4j.LogLevel#INFO} (equals to {@code Level.INFO}) are sent to the SPL trace facility.
It is recommended however that for code clarity, tracing within an operator does not use this
{@code Logger} but instead uses one that maps to the SPL trace facility.
</P>
<P>
Operators may create their own loggers that are children of the {@code com.ibm.streams.operator.log}
{@code Logger} by creating one in a child name space, such as
{@code com.ibm.streams.operator.log.com.example.operators.myoperator}.
</P>
<H2>SPL Trace Facility - Root Logger</H2>
<P>
The SPL trace facility is for application <em>tracing</em>, where tracing is defined as
the recording of application or operator internal events and data.
The purpose of tracing is to allow SPL application or operator developers to debug their applications
or operators.
<P>
The root {@code org.apache.log4j.Logger} for the core logging facility
delivers messages to the SPL trace facility, and thus any child {@code Logger}
will also deliver messages to the SPL trace facility. This means that any named {@code Logger}
<b>not</b> in the {@code com.ibm.streams.operator.log} name space
will deliver messages to the SPL trace facility.
</P>
<P>
When running in as a Streams&reg; distributed or standalone
application the root {@code org.apache.log4j.Logger} has a
{@code org.apache.log4j.Appender}
that sends messages to the SPL trace facility.
The level of the appender and root logger are set the the SPL tracing level of the
processing element and are dynamically updated when the trace level is updated.
The trace level for a processing element may be updated from the command line using:
<BR>
<code>streamtool updatepe -i <I>instanceId</I> --pes <I>peId</I> --config tracing=<I>level</I></code>
</P>
<P>
Dynamic configuration of Apache Log4j loggers is supported so that fine grained
trace can be enabled on a per-logger basis during runtime. The configuration
file {@code log4j.properties} in the application's
{@link com.ibm.streams.operator.ProcessingElement#getDataDirectory() data directory}
is used to update the  Apache Logj configuration. If this file exists and is readable
by the <I>instance owner</I> then the configuration is updated:
<UL>
<LI> When the processing element starts</LI>.
<LI> When the SPL tracing level is updated using {@code streamtool updatepe}.
The file can be created any time after startup.
</LI>
</UL>
The format of {@code log4j.properties} is described in the Apache Log4j javadoc
by the method {@code org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator.doConfigure()}.
<BR>
For example with a set of Java operators using loggers in the name space
{@code com.example.javaop} then tracing could be limited to a single
operator using a logger named {@code com.example.javaop.text.TextExtractOp}
using this {@code log4j.properties}:
<pre>
<code>
# Disable tracing using the parent of loggers for my operators
log4j.logger.com.example.javaop=OFF
# Override the parent to have specific tracing for
# com.example.javaop.text.TextExtractOp
log4j.logger.com.example.javaop.text.TextExtractOp=TRACE
</code>
</pre>
<BR>
It is not recommended to dynamically change the level of the root or
{@code com.ibm.streams.operator.log} loggers.
</P>
<P>
{@link com.ibm.streams.operator.log4j.TraceLevel} provides Java values for SPL trace levels
and also describes the mapping between standard Java {@code org.apache.log4j.Level} values
and SPL trace levels.
</P>
<H2>Logger Levels</H2>
<P>
Setting the level of any {@code Logger} using {@code Logger.setLevel()} does not
change the SPL log or trace level. Such a change only affects that specific logger,
typically this would be used to provide a subset of the current SPL trace level for
specific components, while providing detailed trace for others at the current SPL trace level.
<BR>
Operator implementations must not change the level of either the root or
{@code com.ibm.streams.operator.log} loggers.
</P>
<P>
Operator implementations can be notified of a change in the SPL trace level
using the {@link com.ibm.streams.operator.management.ProcessingElementMXBean#TRACE_LEVEL}
notification. This notification can be used to change the level of an loggers or
appenders to match the SPL trace level if required.
<H2>Message Formatting</H2>
<P>
The root and {@code com.ibm.streams.operator.log} {@code Logger}s have appenders
that passed the rendered string directly to the SPL log or trace facility (using UTF-8 encoding) where
additional formatting (e.g. adding a time stamp) is added before it is written out.
</P>
<H2>Message Localization</H2>
<P>
An operator or library called by an operator may associate a {@code Logger} with a {@code ResourceBundle}
to be used for localizing messages, by using the {@code setResourceBundle} method.
Typically the resource bundles (message files) will be in the jar files containing the operator or library classes.
The {@code Logger.l7dlog} methods utilize the {@code ResourceBundle} associated with the {@code Logger}.
