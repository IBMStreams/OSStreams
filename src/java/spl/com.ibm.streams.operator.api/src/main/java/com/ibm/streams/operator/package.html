Java Operator API for Streams.
The main interface for an operator is {@link com.ibm.streams.operator.Operator Operator},
an instance of operator acts as a processor of tuples. When an <code>Operator</code> has streaming inputs (ports)
incoming tuples are passed into its
{@link com.ibm.streams.operator.Operator#process(StreamingInput, Tuple) process} method as
{@link com.ibm.streams.operator.Tuple Tuple} objects.
An {@link com.ibm.streams.operator.OperatorContext OperatorContext} provides information
about the context the operator is executing in and access to the method to
{@link com.ibm.streams.operator.StreamingOutput#submit(Object) submit} tuples
on its streaming outputs.
<P>
Java Operators are invoked from a IBM Streams Processing Language (SPL) application
either using a Java primitive operator or
the generic <code>spl.utility.JavaOp</code> operator from the SPL Standard toolkit.

<h3>Java Primitive Operators</h3>
A Java primitive operator defines the operator class and its required jar files in
its operator model. In addition the operator model defines the syntax
for the operator, such as expected parameters, ports and windowing semantics.
A Java primitive operator is then is invoked like any other operator within SPL.
<h3>JavaOp</h3>
A JavaOp operator invocation supports these parameters:
<UL>
<LI><code>generated</code> <I>Optional</I> - A boolean parameter, that if set to true it indicates
that the SPL compilation generates classes and interfaces specific to the operator and its ports.
</LI>
<LI><code>className</code> <I>Required </I> - The full class name of the operator that
is used to process and submit tuples. The specified class must implement {@link com.ibm.streams.operator.Operator Operator}.
</LI>
<LI><code>classLibrary</code> <I> Required </I> - Application specific class path elements
required by the operator class, each value corresponds to a single
JAR file or a directory containing Java classes.
</LI>
<LI><code>vmArg</code> <I> Optional </I> Command line arguments passed to the invoked
Java virtual machine the operator is executed within. Operators that are fused into a single processing
element must have equivalent values for vmArg.
While Java system properties can be set using <code>vmArg</code>, the preference should be to set them
within the operator's code, to avoid incompatible <code>vmArg</code> setting for fusing. Only when
a system property is required to be set at JVM startup should it be set using <code>vmArg</code>.
</LI>
</UL>
In addition any number of arbitrary constant parameters can be defined that will be
handled by the application's operator within the class defined by <code>className</code>.
