Encoding of tuples into alternate representations.
<H2>Binary Tuple Representations</H2>

<H3>SPL non-NBF native binary encoding</H3>
<P>
SPL native binary encoding of tuples is
described in the <em>SPL Binary Encoding</em> section of the
<em>SPL Compiler Usage Reference</em>. This format may be used
to serialize tuples that may be later consumed by
a C++ operator, such as writing them to a file for later processing.
Since the format is native, tuples must be encoded and decoded on
a platform architecture with the same byte order. For Java the byte
order is defined by {@code java.nio.ByteOrder.nativeOrder()}.
</P>
<P> The byte representation of encoded tuples
is compatible with the encoding provided by
the C++ SPL Operator API {@code SPL::Tuple} functions
{@code serialize(NativeByteBuffer)} and
{@code deserialize(NativeByteBuffer)}.
<BR>
An instance of {@link com.ibm.streams.operator.encoding.BinaryEncoding} for SPL non-NBF native binary encoding
is obtained from {@link com.ibm.streams.operator.StreamSchema#newNativeBinaryEncoding()}.
<BR>
<EM>The byte representation of encoded tuples is
<b>not</b> compatible with standard Java serialization.</EM>

</P>
<H3>Java Serialization</H3>
Instances of {@link com.ibm.streams.operator.Tuple} implement {@code java.io.Serializable}.
Tuples are serialized using standard Java serialization which is platform independent.
<BR>
<EM>Note that a serialized tuple is is <b>not</b> compatible
with SPL native binary encoding.</EM>
<H2>Character Tuple Representations</H2>

<H3>Character encoding</H3>
<P>
Encoding of tuples into a character encoding is described by
{@link com.ibm.streams.operator.encoding.CharacterEncoding}

<H3>JSON encoding</H3>
<P>
Encoding of tuples as JSON <em>objects</em> is described by
{@link com.ibm.streams.operator.encoding.JSONEncoding}
