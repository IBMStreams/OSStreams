SPL trace and logging for the Java Operator API using the Java&#8482; 2 platform's core logging facilities.
<H2>SPL Log Facility - com.ibm.streams.operator.log Logger</H2>
<P>
The SPL log facility is for application <em>logging</em>, where logging is defined as
the recording of serviceability information pertaining to application or operator events.
The purpose of logging is to provide an administrator with enough information
to do problem determination for items they can potentially control.
In general, very few events are logged in the normal running scenario of an application or operator.
Events pertinent to the failure or partial failure of application runtime scenarios should be logged.
<BR>
The SPL log facility maps to the target use
<em>problem diagnosis by end users and system administrators</em>
described by {@code java.util.Logging}.
</P>
<P>
The {@code java.util.logging.Logger} named {@code com.ibm.streams.operator.log} delivers
log messages to the SPL log facility. {@link com.ibm.streams.operator.logging.LogLevel} provides Java values for SPL log levels
and also describes the mapping between standard Java {@code java.util.logging.Level} values
and SPL log levels.
<BR>
This {@code Logger} accepts any {@code Level} but any log messages at a level
below {@link com.ibm.streams.operator.logging.LogLevel#INFO} (equals to {@code Level.CONFIG}) are sent to the SPL trace facility.
It is recommended however that for code clarity, tracing within an operator does not use this
{@code Logger} but instead uses one that maps to the SPL trace facility.
</P>
<P>
Operators may create their own loggers that are children of the {@code com.ibm.streams.operator.log}
{@code Logger} by creating one in a child name space, such as
{@code com.ibm.streams.operator.log.com.example.operators.myoperator}.
</P>
<H2>SPL Trace Facility - Root Logger</H2>
<P>
The SPL trace facility is for application <em>tracing</em>, where tracing is defined as
the recording of application or operator internal events and data.
The purpose of tracing is to allow SPL application or operator developers to debug their applications
or operators.
The SPL trace facility maps to the target use
<em>problem diagnosis by field service engineers</em>,
<em>problem diagnosis by the development organization</em> and
<em>problem diagnosis by developers</em>
described by {@code java.util.Logging}.
</P>
<P>
The root {@code java.util.logging.Logger} for the core logging facility
delivers messages to the SPL trace facility, and thus any child {@code Logger}
will also deliver messages to the SPL trace facility. This means that any anonymous {@code Logger}
and any named {@code Logger} <b>not</b> in the {@code com.ibm.streams.operator.log} name space
will deliver messages to the SPL trace facility.
</P>
<P>
When running in a Streams&reg; distributed or standalone
application the root {@code java.util.logging.Logger} has a {@code java.util.logging.Handler}
that sends messages to the SPL trace facility.
The level of the handler and root logger are set to the SPL tracing level of the
processing element and are dynamically updated when the trace level is updated.
The trace level for a processing element may be updated from the command line using:
<BR>
<code>streamtool updatepe -i <I>instanceId</I> --pes <I>peId</I> --config tracing=<I>level</I></code>
</P>
<P>
{@link com.ibm.streams.operator.logging.TraceLevel} provides Java values for SPL trace levels
and also describes the mapping between standard Java {@code java.util.logging.Level} values
and SPL trace levels.
</P>
<H2>Logger Levels</H2>
<P>
Setting the level of any {@code Logger} using {@code Logger.setLevel()} does not
change the SPL log or trace level. Such a change only affects that specific logger,
typically this would be used to provide a subset of the current SPL trace level for
specific components, while providing detailed trace for others at the current SPL trace level.
<BR>
Operator implementations must not change the level of either the root or
{@code com.ibm.streams.operator.log} loggers.
</P>
<H2>Message Formatting</H2>
<P>
The root and {@code com.ibm.streams.operator.log} {@code Logger} use a plain formatter that
formats the message using {@code java.util.logging.Formatter.formatMessage()}. The resultant
message is passed directly to the SPL log or trace facility (using UTF-8 encoding) where
additional formatting (e.g. adding a time stamp) is added before it is written out.
</P>
<H2>Message Localization</H2>
<P>
An operator or library called by an operator may create a {@code Logger} with a {@code ResourceBundle}
to be used for localizing messages. Typically the resource bundles (message files) will be in the
jar files containing the operator or library classes.
